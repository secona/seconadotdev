Hello! My name is Vito. I am also known by my last name, secona. This is the start of my blogging journey. I will be blogging a lot about technical stuff like programming and open source contributions. Speaking of open source contributions, I am very grateful to say that I will be working on a [GSoC project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/fTDzc0sk) this summer! I will be working on Cargo Plumbing Commands, which is part of [Rust's 2025H1 project goals](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2025h1/cargo-plumbing.html). The main reason I started this blog is to document my GSoC journey.

## What to Expect?

Expect a lot of blog posts about Rust programming. During the summer of 2025, I will be blogging a lot about GSoC under the tag `gsoc` and `gsoc-2025`. Other than that, I will be blogging a lot about Rust and systems programming, as those two are my focus in my software engineering career. I'm very excited for what's to come.
